# WalkMe jQuery Builder

As part of my role, I am constantly building jQuery selectors and found the constant typing of ":contains", ":first", ":last" etc. tedious.
I was also aware of AI's growing presence and throught I could target both with this project.

Almost all of this project is written by ChatGPT, prompted by me, the full conversation can be found [here](https://chat.openai.com/share/6e23d6a0-404c-4250-837e-c9a2fb4abc21).

The indended use is to copy your class/id/attribute from the dev tools of the page you're working on, alt tab to this app, and hit the relevant keyboard shorcuts displayed next to each button.
